                  <p> He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy
                     named Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody
                     served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by
                     looking out for each member of the group. When Andy enters
                     adulthood and leaves for college, Woody is donated to a little
                     girl named Bonnie Anderson. He remains with Bonnie for some time,
                     before choosing to become an owner-less antique devoted to helping
                     lost toys find owners, alongside his girlfriend Bo Peep.
